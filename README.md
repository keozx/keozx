Senior Software Engineer  
Continuous Delivery & Collaborative Systems

## About

I build software using what I call **Collaborative Software Engineering (CSE)** — a disciplined approach that combines:

- Continuous Delivery  
- ATDD / BDD & executable specifications  
- Test-Driven Development  
- Mob & Pair Programming  
- Domain-driven collaboration  

My focus is simple:

> Optimize feedback loops.  
> Make quality the default outcome.  
> Design systems that remain adaptable over time.

I’m particularly interested in how engineering practices shape team performance, not just code quality.

## What You’ll Find Here

This profile contains experiments, prototypes, and explorations around:

- Executable specifications and living documentation
- Continuous Delivery pipelines
- Cross-platform architecture (.NET, Kotlin Multiplatform)
- Functional and reactive patterns
- Systems-oriented engineering approaches

Some repositories are exploratory. Others are production-inspired patterns extracted and simplified for learning.

## Current Areas of Exploration

- Living Documentation without vendor lock-in  
- Executable specifications as shared artifacts  
- Engineering systems aligned with DORA high-performance capabilities  
- Kotlin Multiplatform & cross-platform mobile architecture

## Philosophy

I believe:

- Software is a socio-technical system.
- Delivery capability is more important than individual velocity.
- Shared ownership outperforms individual brilliance.
- Executable specifications are the most honest form of documentation.
- Continuous Delivery is a scientific approach to software development.

## Let’s Connect

If you’re interested in:

- Continuous Delivery practices  
- ATDD / BDD at scale  
- Mob Programming experiences  
- Building resilient engineering systems  

Feel free to reach out or open discussions.

I’m always interested in exchanging ideas with other engineers who care about how we build, not just what we build.
